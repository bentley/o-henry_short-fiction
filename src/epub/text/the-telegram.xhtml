						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Young lady</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>
						<td>We claim to deliver messages quicker than the post-office, ma’am. You can send ten words to Waco for twenty-five cents.</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Young lady</td>
						<td>Give me another blank, please: I guess that will be enough. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">After five minutes’ hard work she produces the following: “Ring was awfully lovely. Come down as soon as you can. Mamie.”</i></td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>
						<td>This contains eleven words. That will be thirty cents.</td>

						<td>Oh, gracious! I wanted that nickel to buy gum with.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>
						<td>Let’s see. You might strike out, “awfully,” and that will make it all right.</td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Young lady</td>
						<td>Indeed I shan’t. You ought to see that ring. I’ll give you the thirty cents.</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>
						<td><i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Wearily.</i> I assure you there is no personal interest expressed in the question. We have to know the name and address in order to send the message.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Young lady</td>
						<td>Oh, yes. I didn’t think of that. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">She writes the name and address, pays the thirty cents and departs. Twenty minutes later she returns, out of breath.</i></td>

						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>
						<td>Is it anything important?</td>

					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Young lady</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Clerk</td>
						<td>Certainly, and we have some real nice violet extract; would you like a few drops on your telegram?</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td epub:type="z3998:persona">Young lady</td>
						<td>Oh, yes: so kind of you. I expect to send all my telegrams through your office, you have been so accommodating. Good morning.</td>
