			<h2 epub:type="title">A Tragedy</h2>
			<p>“By the beard of the Prophet. Oh, Scheherezade, right well hast thou done,” said the Caliph, leaning back and biting off the end of a three-for.</p>
			<p>For one thousand nights Scheherezade <abbr>No.</abbr> 2, daughter of the Grand Vizier, had sat at the feet of the mighty Caliph of the Indies relating tales that held the court entranced and breathless.</p>
			<p>The soft, melodious sound of falling water from the fountain tinkled pleasantly upon the ear. Slaves sprinkled attar of roses upon the tessellated floor, and waved jeweled fans of peacock’s feathers in the air. Outside, in the palace gardens the bulbul warbled in the date trees, the hoodoo flitted among the banyan branches, and the dying song of the goo-goo floated in upon the breeze from New York.</p>
			<p>“And, now, oh, Scheherezade,” continued the Caliph, “your contract calls for one more tale. One thousand have you told unto us, and we have rejoiced exceedingly at your narrative powers. Your stories are all new and do not weary us as do the chestnuts of Marshall P. Wilder. You are quite a peach. But, listen, oh, Daughter of the Moon, and first cousin to a phonograph, there is one more yet to come. Let it be one that has never before been related in the Kingdom. If it be thus, thou shalt have 10,000 gold pieces and a hundred slaves at thy command, but if it bear whiskers, then shall thy head pay the forfeit.”</p>
			<p>The Caliph made a sign, and Mesrour, the executioner, stepped to the side of Scheherezade. In his dark hand he held a glittering scimeter. He folded his arms and stood like a statue as the Caliph spoke again.</p>
			<p>“Now, oh, Scheherezade, let her go. If it be that thou givest us something like that tale <abbr>No.</abbr> 475, where the Bagdad merchant was found by his favorite wife at the roof-garden concert, with his typewriter, or <abbr>No.</abbr> 684, where the Qadi of a certain town came home late from the lodge with his shoes off and stepped upon a tack, all will be well, but if you work off a Joe Miller on us, verily you get it in the neck.”</p>
			<p>Scheherezade took a fresh chew of gum, sat down on one foot and began.</p>
			<p>“Oh, mighty Caliph, I have one story that would hold you spellbound. I call it my 288 story. But I really can not tell it. I⁠—”</p>
			<p>“And why not, oh, Scheherezade?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Brother to the Sun, and Private Secretary to the Milky Way, I am a modest woman, it is too gross, too gross to relate.”</p>
			<p>Scheherezade covered her face in confusion.</p>
			<p>“Speak, I command you,” said the Caliph, drawing nearer. “You need not mind me. I have read Laura Lean Jibbey and Isben. Go on with 288.”</p>
			<p>“I have said it, oh, Caliph. It is too gross.”</p>
			<p>The Caliph made a sign: Mesrour, the executioner, whirled his scimeter through the air and the head of Scheherezade rolled upon the floor. The Caliph pulled his beard and muttered softly to himself:</p>
			<p>“I knew all the time that 288 is two gross, but puns don’t go anywhere in my jurisdiction at present.”</p>
